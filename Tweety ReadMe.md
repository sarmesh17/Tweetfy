Tweetfy is a modern Android application designed to provide users with a seamless experience for browsing and interacting with Twitter content. The app utilizes Retrofit for efficient data retrieval, follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for a clear separation of concerns, integrates Jetpack Compose for building the user interface, relies on Kotlin for its backend logic, utilizes Hilt for dependency injection, and employs Navigation for smooth transitions between screens.
